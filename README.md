# Python_PageSpeed_webscraper_for_SEO
I've written a simple python code using BeautifulSoup4 and Requests Libraries that helps user to get real time data about the PageSpeed performance of the page on both Desktops and Mobile Platforms of the URL he/she wants to know about. This is just a simple script that user can access through their terminals its not a GUI based app.
